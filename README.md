# Machine Learning Specialization
## University of Washington

### Course 1 - Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
- __Regression__: Predicting House Prices (Linear Regression)
- __Classification__: Analyzing Sentiment (Logistic Regression, Recall/Precision, ROC)
- __Clustering and Similarity__: Retrieving Documents (TFIDF)
- __Recommending Products__ (Popularity based / Collaborative Filtering)
- __Deep Learning__: Searching for Images (ImageNet, Deep Features


### Course 2 - Machine Learning: Regression
- __Simple Linear Regression__ (Closed-Form Solution, Gradient Descent)
- __Multiple Regression__ (Importance of vectorized computation)
- __Assessing Performance__ (Training + Validation + Testing)
- __Ridge Regression__: Use L2 Penalty to reduce variance & prevent overfitting
- __Feature Selection & Lasso__: Use L1 Penalty to select features; importance of normalized features; Coordinate Descent
- __Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression__: 
  - Pros:
    - KNN regression can do perfect fit with infinite data points;
    - Make few assumptions about f(x)
    - Global fits of parametric models vs. local fits of kernel regression Weighted KNN
  - Cons:
    - Computational expensive with high dimensional data;
    - Need for large amount of data that evenly distributed to cover all possibilities for good performance
  - Global fits of parametric models vs. local fits of kernel regression (Weighted KNN & Kernel Regression

### Course 3 - Machine Learning: Classification
